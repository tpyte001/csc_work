I am doing a project in my computational physics class where I am doing adaptive
integration to integrate functions to high degrees of accuracy. It's cool because 
alot of the project is finding clever mathematical ways to keep my calculations in python
down. It's math heavy and it makes me feel like a software engineer.

to complete that project I need to get better at numpy and recursion, along with some other
maths technique like error approximation and better understanding simpsons rule, the trapezoid
method of integration. The idea is to calculate an approximate integral using the trapezoid
method and then recursively call that calculation to better approximate my answer. I don't know 
if I can explain it that well now but maybe in about 3 journal entries I will have a stronger
understanding of the process and be able to articulate it better.

I really want to learn C, C speaks to me. I like how much hardware interaction it has and I want
to learn how to work directly with memory addressess. I don't really know what it is about C but
it just seems so cool. Lua is another one I have aspirations to learn too. And Javascript.
Mathematica too.
